# Vosk Offline Speech Recognition Setup

## Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Replaced Android's SpeechRecognizer with Vosk library
- Added Vosk dependencies to build.gradle.kts
- Implemented VoskSpeechRecognitionManager
- Built successfully with fallback simulation mode
- Maintains all existing functionality (audio cues, UI, API calls)

üîÑ **Current Mode: Simulation**
- The app currently runs in simulation mode since no Vosk model is bundled
- Shows "Listening... Speak now (offline)" in UI
- Simulates speech recognition with partial results
- Returns mock text: "Hello, can you help me with this image"

## Benefits of Vosk vs Android SpeechRecognizer

| Feature | Android SpeechRecognizer | Vosk |
|---------|-------------------------|------|
| **Internet Required** | ‚ùå YES (Google's servers) | ‚úÖ NO (completely offline) |
| **Privacy** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio sent to Google | ‚úÖ All processing on-device |
| **Latency** | ~200-500ms (network) | ‚úÖ <50ms (local) |
| **Reliability** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on network | ‚úÖ Always available |
| **Cost** | üÜì Free (with privacy cost) | üÜì Free (true privacy) |
| **Accuracy** | üî• Excellent | üëç Good (model dependent) |

## Next Steps: Adding Real Vosk Models

### Option 1: Download and Bundle Small Model (Recommended)

1. **Download a small English model:**
   ```bash
   cd app/src/main/assets
   wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
   unzip vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
   ```

2. **Update SpeechRecognitionManager.kt:**
   ```kotlin
   private fun loadModelFromAssets(): Boolean {
       return try {
           val assetManager = context.assets
           val modelDir = File(context.filesDir, modelName)
           
           // Copy from assets to internal storage
           copyAssetFolder(assetManager, modelName, modelDir.absolutePath)
           
           model = Model(modelDir.absolutePath)
           isModelReady = true
           true
       } catch (e: Exception) {
           false
       }
   }
   ```

### Option 2: Download on First Run

1. **Add download functionality:**
   ```kotlin
   private suspend fun downloadModel() {
       val url = "https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip"
       // Download and extract to internal storage
   }
   ```

2. **Show download progress in UI**

### Option 3: Prompt User to Download

1. Add settings screen for model management
2. Let user choose which model to download
3. Support multiple languages

## Model Sizes & Languages

| Model | Size | Language | Accuracy |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 | ~40MB | English | Good |
| vosk-model-en-us-0.22 | ~1.8GB | English | Excellent |
| vosk-model-small-cn-0.22 | ~42MB | Chinese | Good |
| vosk-model-small-ru-0.22 | ~45MB | Russian | Good |

## Technical Notes

- **Current fallback:** App works with simulated speech recognition
- **No network dependency:** Once model is added, completely offline
- **Memory usage:** ~100-200MB RAM for small models
- **CPU usage:** Minimal on modern devices
- **Storage:** 40MB-2GB depending on model choice

## Testing the Integration

The app currently:
1. ‚úÖ Builds successfully
2. ‚úÖ Shows "offline" in status message
3. ‚úÖ Plays audio cues (ding-dong sounds)
4. ‚úÖ Simulates partial speech results
5. ‚úÖ Sends mock text + image to API server
6. ‚úÖ Plays TTS response

**To test with real speech:** Add a Vosk model following Option 1 above.
