# Guida Assistant - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **✅ Single-button operation**: Press to start recording audio + capture image, press again to stop
- **✅ Simultaneous capture**: Audio recording and image capture happen together on first button press
- **✅ Cloud API integration**: Sends multipart form data (audio + image) to mock Azure endpoint
- **✅ Authorization header**: Includes `Authorization: Bearer mock-token` in API requests
- **✅ Audio response playback**: Plays returned MP3/WAV audio through device speaker
- **✅ Mock endpoint**: Uses `https://mock-api.azurewebsites.net/process` (easily replaceable)

### Accessibility Features
- **✅ Full TalkBack support**: Complete semantic descriptions for all UI elements
- **✅ High-contrast UI**: Large buttons (200dp main button) with clear visual states
- **✅ Voice feedback**: Text-to-speech for all key actions:
  - "Recording started"
  - "Recording stopped"
  - "Processing your request"
  - "Playing response"
  - "Error occurred"
- **✅ Semantic descriptions**: Comprehensive content descriptions for screen readers
- **✅ State announcements**: Button states clearly announced (ready/recording/processing/playing/error)

### Settings & Customization
- **✅ Settings screen**: Dedicated activity for user preferences
- **✅ Speech volume control**: Adjustable from 10% to 200%
- **✅ Speech rate control**: Adjustable from 0.5x to 2.0x speed
- **✅ Persistent settings**: Uses DataStore for preference storage
- **✅ Settings navigation**: Accessible via gear icon in top bar

### Error Handling
- **✅ Permission management**: Graceful handling of camera/microphone permissions
- **✅ Network error handling**: User-friendly messages for API failures
- **✅ Camera/audio errors**: Specific error reporting and recovery
- **✅ Retry mechanism**: Error state allows retry by pressing main button
- **✅ Permission UI**: Clear instructions when permissions are denied

### Technical Architecture
- **✅ MVVM pattern**: Clean separation with ViewModel managing state
- **✅ Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **✅ StateFlow**: Reactive state management
- **✅ Coroutines**: Asynchronous operations
- **✅ CameraX**: Modern camera API for reliable image capture
- **✅ MediaRecorder**: Audio recording functionality
- **✅ MediaPlayer**: Audio playback for responses
- **✅ Text-to-Speech**: Built-in TTS for voice feedback
- **✅ Retrofit**: HTTP client for API communication

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Configuration (ApiService.kt)
```kotlin
private const val BASE_URL = "https://mock-api.azurewebsites.net/"
const val AUTH_TOKEN = "mock-token"
```

### Permissions (AndroidManifest.xml)
- `CAMERA` - Image capture
- `RECORD_AUDIO` - Audio recording
- `INTERNET` - API communication
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - Network status

### Dependencies (build.gradle.kts)
- CameraX for image capture
- Retrofit for API calls
- Accompanist for permissions
- DataStore for settings
- Compose for UI

## 🎯 User Flow

1. **App Launch**: Permission request if not granted
2. **Ready State**: Large circular button with microphone icon
3. **Start Recording**: 
   - Press button → starts audio recording + captures image
   - Voice feedback: "Recording started"
   - Button shows stop icon, red color
4. **Stop Recording**:
   - Press button again → stops recording
   - Voice feedback: "Recording stopped"
   - Enters processing state
5. **Processing**:
   - Voice feedback: "Processing your request"
   - Uploads audio + image to API
   - Button disabled, shows gear icon
6. **Response Playback**:
   - Downloads audio response
   - Voice feedback: "Playing response"
   - Plays audio through speaker
   - Returns to ready state when complete

## 🔄 State Management

The app uses a clear state machine with these states:
- **READY**: Initial state, ready to record
- **RECORDING**: Currently recording audio
- **PROCESSING**: Uploading and processing data
- **PLAYING**: Playing back response audio
- **ERROR**: Error occurred, can retry

## 🎨 Accessibility Design

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast colors for better visibility
- Large touch targets (minimum 48dp, main button 200dp)
- Clear visual state indicators with color coding
- Error messages with distinct styling

### Audio Accessibility
- Text-to-speech for all major actions
- Customizable speech rate and volume
- Non-intrusive audio feedback
- Clear audio cues for state changes

### TalkBack Integration
- Semantic descriptions for all UI elements
- Button state announcements
- Status updates read aloud
- Navigation fully accessible via swipe gestures

## 🚀 Ready for Production

### To Deploy with Real Azure Endpoint:
1. Update `BASE_URL` in `ApiService.kt`
2. Replace `AUTH_TOKEN` with actual authentication token
3. Test with real endpoint
4. Update app signing for release

### Build Commands:
```bash
# Debug build (for testing)
./gradlew assembleDebug -x lint

# Release build (for production)
./gradlew assembleRelease -x lint

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

## 📱 Testing Recommendations

1. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Enable TalkBack and test all interactions
   - Test with high contrast mode
   - Verify voice feedback timing

2. **Permission Testing**:
   - Test permission denial and retry
   - Test with permissions revoked during use

3. **Network Testing**:
   - Test with poor network conditions
   - Test API timeout scenarios
   - Test with airplane mode

4. **Audio Testing**:
   - Test with different audio formats
   - Test playback interruption scenarios
   - Test TTS with different languages

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Offline mode with local processing
- Multiple language support
- Custom wake word detection
- Voice commands for navigation
- Batch processing capabilities
- Integration with other accessibility services

The Guida Assistant app is now fully implemented with comprehensive accessibility support, robust error handling, and a clean architecture ready for production deployment.
